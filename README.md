# Skin_cancer_prediction_deeplearning
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify skin cancer images into benign and malignant categories. The model achieved an accuracy of 90%.
# Introduction
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to build a CNN model that can accurately classify skin lesions as benign or malignant.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of skin lesions. The images are categorized into two classes: benign and malignant.

#Model Architecture
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features from the images and perform classification.

#Training
The model was trained on the dataset using supervised learning. Various techniques such as data augmentation and dropout were used to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

#Evaluation
The model was evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy. The final model achieved an accuracy of 90% in classifying skin lesions.
